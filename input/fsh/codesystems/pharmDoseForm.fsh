The backing sheet is impermeable to the active substance(s) and normally impermeable to water. In reservoir systems the active substance may be dissolved or dispersed in a semi-solid basis or in a solid polymer matrix, which is separated from the skin by a rate-controlling membrane. The pressure-sensitive adhesive may, in this case, be applied to some or all parts of the membrane, or only around the border of the membrane and the backing sheet. Matrix systems contain the active substance in a solid or semi-solid matrix, the properties of which control the diffusion pattern to the skin. The matrix system may also be a solution or dispersion of the active substance in the pressure-sensitive adhesive. The releasing surface of the patch is covered by a protective liner to be removed before applying the patch to the skin."
